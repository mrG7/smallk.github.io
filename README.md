Introduction
----------------
Smallk is a high performance software package for low rank matrix approximation via the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). NMF is 
a low-rank approximation where a matrix is approximated 
by a product of two nonnegative factors. 
The role of NMF in data analysis has been as significant as the singular value decomposition (SVD) due to the 
interpretability of its results, which is a consequence of the nonnegativity constraints.
Our approach to solving the NMF nonconvex optimization
problem has proven convergence properties and is one of the most efficient 
method developed to date.
