Introduction
----------------
SmallK is a high performance software package for low rank matrix approximation via the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). NMF is 
a low-rank approximation where a matrix is approximated 
by a product of two nonnegative factors. 
The role of NMF in data analytics has been as significant as the singular value decomposition (SVD). However, due to 
nonnegativity constraints, NMF has far superior interpretability of its results for many practical problems such as image processing, chemometrics, bioinformatics, topic modeling for text analytics and many more.
Our approach to solving the NMF nonconvex optimization
problem has proven convergence properties and is one of the most efficient 
methods developed to date.
