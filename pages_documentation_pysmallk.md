<h2 id="intro"> Introduction </h2>
Why Python? Although it’s perfectly fine to run SmallK from the command line, Python provides a great deal more flexibility that augments the C++ code with other tasks that are much more easily accomplished with a very high level language. Python distributions can be easily extended with open source libraries from third party sources as well, two examples being numpy and scipy, well-known standards for scientific computing in the Python community. There are numerous packages available that extend these scientific libraries into the data analytics domain as well, such as [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html).For using scientific Python, we strongly recommend the Anaconda Python distribution provided by [Continuum Analytics](http://continuum.io/). Download and installation instructions for all platforms can be found [here](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/). Anaconda includes many if not most of the commonly used scientific and data analytics packages available and a very easy to use package manager and updating system. After installing Anaconda there will be available at the command line both a standard Python interpreter (type ‘python’) and an iPython interpreter (type ‘ipython’). We recommend using the iPython interpreter. In addition to the command line interfaces to Python, Anaconda includes the Spyder visual development environment featuring a very well thought out interface that makes developing Python code almost “too easy”. Spyder has many features found in the Matlab™ editor and a similar look and feel.Anaconda also includes the Cython package, which is used by SmallK to integrate the Python and C++ code. [Cython](http://cython.org/) includes support for most of the C++ standard and supports the latest GNU C++ compilers. Most if not all the standard libraries are supported and the latest version (20.2) has support for the standard template library (STL) as well.<h2 id="examples"> Examples of Pysmallk Usage </h2>

Pysmallk has five classes, each of which represents one of the SmallK tools: SmallkAPI (the simplistic Smallk API), Flatclust, Hierclust, Matrixgen, and Preprocessor. These tools can be strung together into various kind of applications. Examples of such applications can be found in examples/pysmallk_example.py and in the pysmallk/tests/ subdirectory.

Let's suppose that we have a sparse matrix representing text data that we want to load into the SmallK software and evaluate the effect of different input parameters.

First, we will need to import the appropriate classes:

	from pysmallk import Preprocessor
	from pysmallk import SmallkAPI
	
We then should apply the preprocessor to our data:

	p = pysmallk.Preprocessor()
	p.load_matrix(filepath=/path/to/input/matrix.mtx)
	p.load_dictionary(filepath=/path/to/input/dictionary.txt)
	p.load_documents(filepath=/path/to/input/documents.txt)
	
We will begin with the default inputs and run preprocess:
	
	p.preprocess()
	
Instead of writing the results to files, we can get them from the Preprocessor class and pass them directly to the SmallkAPI class.

	reduced_docs = p.get_reduced_documents()
	reduced_dict = p.get_reduced_dictionary()
	reduced_scores = p.get_reduced_scores()
	reduced_row_indices = p.get_reduced_row_indices()
	reduced_col_offsets = p.get_reduced_col_offsets()
	reduced_height = len(reduced_dict)
	reduced_width = len(reduced_docs)

	sk = pysmallk.SmallkAPI()

	sk.load_matrix(buffer=reduced_scores, row_indices=reduced_row_indices, col_offsets=reduced_col_offsets, height=reduced_height, width=reduced_width, nz=len(reduced_scores))

	sk.load_dictionary(dictionary=reduced_dict)
	sk.hiernmf2(5)

	sk.finalize()
